# Getting started Astor

## Compilation and installation

     git clone https://github.com/SpoonLabs/astor.git
     cd astor
     mvn install

Warning: Windows is only partially supported.

## Creating astor.jar

     mvn package -DskipTests=true
     
The following JAR will be created: `target/astor-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`  
This will referenced as `astor.jar` for the rest of this guide.

## jGenProg

We present a command line with the required arguments for executing jGenProg.  Optional arguments can find using option -help are listed below. They arguments can also be changed  in "configuration.properties".

Getting started: 

     git clone https://github.com/SpoonLabs/astor.git
     cd astor
     mvn clean compile # compiling  astor
     cd examples/Math-issue-280
     mvn clean compile test  # compiling and running bug example
     cd ../../
     mvn dependency:build-classpath | egrep -v "(^\[INFO\]|^\[WARNING\])" | tee /tmp/astor-classpath.txt
     cat /tmp/astor-classpath.txt
     
Then the main command (note that the "location" argument is mandatory, and must be an absolute path):

     java -cp $(cat /tmp/astor-classpath.txt):target/classes fr.inria.main.evolution.AstorMain -mode jgenprog -srcjavafolder /src/java/ -srctestfolder /src/test/  -binjavafolder /target/classes/ -bintestfolder  /target/test-classes/ -location /home/user/astor/examples/Math-issue-280/ -dependencies examples/Math-issue-280/lib


Output: Astor uses the standard output to print the solutions (i.e., the patches code), if any. 
Astor writes in the output folder (property `workingDirectory` in the mentioned command line), a folder with all the variants that fulfill the goals i.e., repair the bugs. Example output:

```

Each variant folder contains the files that Astor has analyzed (and eventually modified). Additionally, it contains a file called `patch.diff` that summarized all changes done in the variant.
The summary of the execution is also printed on the screen at the end of the execution. If there is at least one solution, it prints “Solution found” and then it lists the program variants that are solution i.e., they fixed versions of the program. Then, if you go to the folder to each of those variants, the file patch appears, which summarizes the changes done for repairing the bug. In other words, the file `patch.diff` is only present if the variant is a valid solution (fixes the failing test and no regression).
If Astor does not find any solution in the execution, it prints at the screen something like “Not solution found”. 


Moreover, Astor saves the patched version of the program on disk.
The Astor's output is located in folder "./output_astor". You can change it through command line argument '-out'. There Astor writes a JSON file ('astor_output.json') which summarizes the information of each patch found (location, code modified, etc.) and some statistics.
Inside the folder "/src/" Astor stores the source code of the solutions that it found.

Folder “default” contains the original program, without any modification. It's a sanity check, it’s the output of spoon without applying any processor over the spoon model of the application under repair.

Each folder "variant-x" is a valid solution to the repair problem (passes all tests). The "x" corresponds to the id (unique identifier) assigned to a variant. There is an command line argument `saveall` that allows you to save all variants that Astor generates, even they are not solution.

## jKali

## jMutRepair

For executing Astor in jMutRepair mode:

    java  -cp astor.jar fr.inria.main.evolution.AstorMain -mode jMutRepair -location <>......

    -location "absolute location of the project to repair" (**MANDATORY**)

    -dependencies "folder with the dependencies of the application to repair" 

    -failing "failing test case" (if there are several failing test case, give them separated by the classpath separator (: in linux/mac  and ; in windows)
        
    -package "package to manipulate" (only the statements from this package are manipulated to find a patch)

    -jvm4testexecution "Path to the Java VM used by Astor to execute the validation (e.g., running test cases). It must reference to the `bin` subfolder"

    -srctestfolder "test source code folder"
    
    -binjavafolder "class folder"
    
    -bintestfolder "test class folder" 
    
  
    
### Command line arguments example Math-70 from Defects4J: 
	
	-location <PATH_TO_ASTOR_FOLDER>/examples/math_70 
  	
    -mode statement
	
	-package  org.apache.commons 
	
	-jvm4testexecution "<PATH_TO_JVM_FOLDER>"/bin/ 
	
	-failing org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.BisectionSolverTest
	
	-srcjavafolder /src/java/
	
	-srctestfolder /src/test/
	
	-binjavafolder /target/classes
	
	-bintestfolder /target/test-classes 
	
	-flthreshold 0.5 
	 
	-stopfirst true 
	
	-dependencies <PATH_TO_ASTOR_FOLDER>examples/libs/junit-4.4.jar, 

Note that `-location` argument has a absolute path to the project to repair, and -dependency has the absolute path to the libraries or to the folder that contains them.
However, note that the folders that specify the structure of the project under repair (`-srcjavafolder`, `-srctestfolder`, `-binjavafolder` and `-bintestfolder`) are relative.

# Notes about running Astor over [Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) bugs.


## Common problem running Java 7 apps: `UnsupportedClassVersionError (unsupported major.minor version 52.0` 


Astor needs to be executed over a JVM 8+. By default, Astor uses the JVM specified on the `JAVA_HOME` variable to run the test cases for validating candidate patches. However, Defects4J subjects needs to be executed using a JMV 7 (according to the official documentation).
For example, running bug Math-70 from Defects4J on a JVM 8 could produce two failing/errored test cases:

  	testMath280(org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest)
	testMinpackMeyer(org.apache.commons.math.estimation.MinpackTest)

The first one (`testMath280`) is the test that expose the bug Math-70. It's correct that it fails. However, the second one (`testMinpackMeyer`) fails due to the JVM and it must not fail. It's a platform-related error.
As conclusion, using a java VM 8+ could produce that Astor does not find patches for bugs that must be repaired by the tool.

As solution, Astor provides an argument (`-jvm4testexecution`) to specify the location of the virtual machine that will be used to run the test cases. In the case of trying to repair Defects4J bugs it must be a JVM 7, otherwise the result of test cases could not be the expected (i.e., having more failing test cases) and, consequently, patches could not be found.

Astor tries to automatically obtain the version of the JDK used to running the tests (e.g., `-jvm4testexecution`).
Astor will log (INFO level) the version obtained: 
`Java version of the JDK used to run tests: 1.8.0_101`.

Then, Astor determines whether the JVM version is lower or equals than 7 and will log (INFO level) the result `The compliance of the JVM is:  8`.

In case that the JVM is version 7 and Astor is not able to determine the version (i.e., the previous logs do not show any information), you can force Astor to run Java7 code by using the command line argument  `runjava7code`.

## Important configuration when running Astor Jar:


If after doing the previous steps Astor produces the exception  `UnsupportedClassVersionError (unsupported major.minor version 52.0)` and you are running Astor using the jar (`astor-0.X.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar`), 
you will need to add  the jar `<astor_location>/lib/jtestex7.jar` in the java classplath (attention: add it *before* the astor jar).

## FAQ

Q. I get following error after running Astor: `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The bin folder /home/user/astor/examples/Math-issue-280/target/classes does not exist`   
A. Run `mvn clean compile test` again in the example issue folder.  

Q. I get following error after running Astor: `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The bin folder /home/user/astor/examples/Math-issue-280/target/test-classes does not exist`  
A. Run `mvn test-compile` in the example issue folder.
